MvcOdata
========

a repo for a PoC and experimentation around using OData Controllers and WCF Data services

[OData.csproj](https://github.com/ImaginaryDevelopment/MvcOdata/tree/master/OData) - the front end - enables ajax calls through the web layer to be made via OData url conventions.

[Webby.csproj](https://github.com/ImaginaryDevelopment/MvcOdata/tree/master/Webby) - Jason Gerard's auto-hosting WCF services code

[Contracts.csproj](https://github.com/ImaginaryDevelopment/MvcOdata/tree/master/Contracts) - the shared contracts assembly describes the domain objects and repositories

[WcfData.csproj](https://github.com/ImaginaryDevelopment/MvcOdata/tree/master/WcfData) - Peter Lacomb's WCF Data services layer
